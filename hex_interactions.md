Hexii Game Design: Hexagon Synergy SystemVersion: 2.1Core Concept: The player builds a ship out of hexagons. Every hexagon has a Color and a Role.The Architecture:Global Passive: Simply having the hex attached adds to a global stat (e.g., +HP).Local Active: The hex performs an action (shoots, shields, etc.). This action is modified by its 6 immediate neighbors.1. The Color RolesColorRoleGlobal Passive StatBase Active BehaviorREDWeapon+5% Global DamageTurret: Shoots a projectile at the cursor.BLUEField+10 Max ShieldField Gen: Creates a short-range circular aura.YELLOWMobility+5% Move SpeedThruster: Adds acceleration force.GREENVitality+10 Max HPBio-Node: Regenerates HP over time.CYANUtility+15 Pickup RangeMagnet: Pulls XP/Items toward the ship.ORANGEDefense+5 Damage ReductionArmor: Reduces damage & deals contact damage.2. Interaction MatricesHow to read: The Subject is the main hex performing the action. The Neighbor is the attached hex modifying that action.🔴 RED HEX (The Weapon)Base: Shoots 1 Standard Bullet every 1.0s.NeighborEffect on RED HexVisual Feedback+ REDMultishot: Adds +1 projectile per neighbor (Simultaneous fire).Multiple barrels appear on the hex.+ BLUEPhasing Rounds: Bullets pass through walls and ignore enemy armor.Bullets have a ghostly blue outline.+ YELLOWGatling Logic: Fire rate increases the longer you hold the trigger (Spin-up).Barrel spins visually.+ GREENBio-Ordnance: Bullets grow in size and damage as they travel distance.Bullets start small, become huge.+ CYANHoming Missiles: Projectiles curve toward the nearest enemy.Bullets have small thruster trails.+ ORANGEHeavy Impact: Bullets lose speed but gain massive Knockback.Bullets look like heavy cannonballs.🔵 BLUE HEX (The Force Field)Base: Emits a circular aura. Requires neighbors to define the field's effect.NeighborEffect on BLUE HexVisual Feedback+ REDThermal Field: Deals Damage Per Second (DPS) to enemies inside.Burning red ring.+ BLUEResonance: Increases the tick rate (damage/slows happen faster).Field pulses rapidly.+ YELLOWStatic Charge: Enemies entering the field are briefly "Stunned" (0.5s).Yellow electric sparks.+ GREENLeech Field: Damage dealt by this field heals the player's HP.Green + signs float up on hit.+ CYANAmplifier: Significantly increases the Radius of the field.The circle expands visibly.+ ORANGEStasis Field: Enemies inside the field are Slowed by 40%.Field looks like thick sludge/viscous.🟡 YELLOW HEX (The Engine)Base: Adds movement force.NeighborEffect on YELLOW HexVisual Feedback+ REDAfterburner: Leaves a trail of fire behind the ship (DPS).Flame trail particles.+ BLUEIon Shield: Moving generates a temporary shield (Decays when stopped).Blue energy wraps rear of ship.+ YELLOWTurbo: Adds a "Dash" ability (Double tap direction).Exhaust flames turn blue/white.+ GREENPhotosynthesis: Moving leaves a trail of healing spores (Heals self if looped).Trail of flowers/spores.+ CYANVacuum Wake: Moving creates suction behind the ship, clumping enemies.Wind distortion lines trailing behind.+ ORANGERamming Speed: While moving at max speed, collision damage is increased 200%.Spikes extend from the thruster.🟢 GREEN HEX (The Healer)Base: Passive HP Regeneration.NeighborEffect on GREEN HexVisual Feedback+ REDAdrenaline: Killing an enemy instantly triggers a regen tick.Red pulse on kill.+ BLUEOver-Shield: If HP is full, regen ticks fill the Shield bar instead.Blue particles rising.+ YELLOWMetabolism: Regeneration ticks happen faster based on Move Speed.Hex glows brighter when moving fast.+ GREENSymbiosis: Linearly increases the healing amount (+1 HP per tick).Roots connecting the Green hexes.+ CYANNutrients: Collecting XP orbs heals +1 HP immediately.Small green flash on XP pickup.+ ORANGEBarkskin: Grants temporary Armor buffs after a heal tick.Hex turns wood-brown briefly.🧲 CYAN HEX (The Utility)Base: Pulls XP/Items.NeighborEffect on CYAN HexVisual Feedback+ REDUnstable Isotope: XP Orbs become volatile. Collection triggers small AoE explosions.XP Orbs pulse red.+ BLUEEnergy Siphon: XP Orbs recharge Shield upon collection.XP Orbs have a blue halo.+ YELLOWHyper-loop: XP Orbs accelerate toward player faster (prevents "orbiting").XP Orbs have speed trails.+ GREENBio-Fuel: XP Orbs heal HP upon collection.XP Orbs leave a green trail.+ CYANWide Net: Exponentially increases pickup range.A faint radar wave ping.+ ORANGECorrosion Field: Enemies within pickup range have Reduced Armor (Take +30% Dmg).Nearby enemies turn grey/rusted.🟠 ORANGE HEX (The Defense)Base: Damage Reduction & Collision Damage.NeighborEffect on ORANGE HexVisual Feedback+ REDReactive Plating: When hit, fires shrapnel/spikes outward.Spikes pop out when player is hit.+ BLUEReflector: Chance to reflect enemy projectiles back at them.Shiny mirror surface.+ YELLOWKinetic Absorber: Taking damage boosts Ship Speed for 2 seconds.Glows bright orange when hit.+ GREENLiving Hull: If not hit for 5s, repairs itself/adds temporary HP.Nanobot particles hovering.+ CYANEntropy: Melee attackers touching this hex permanently lose Defense stats.Enemies hitting you flash "Broken" icon.+ ORANGEFortress: Grants Knockback Immunity.Heavy iron/riveted texture.3. The "Ring of Perfection" (Ultimates)If a center hex is surrounded by 6 neighbors of the SAME color, the center hex transforms into an Apex Component.6 RED Surrounding X: Omni-Turret. The center hex shoots in all 6 directions simultaneously.6 BLUE Surrounding X: Aegis. Grants 3 seconds of Invulnerability whenever the Shield breaks (Cooldown 30s).6 YELLOW Surrounding X: Chronos. Generates a static field that slows enemy projectiles (not enemies) to a near halt.6 GREEN Surrounding X: Yggdrasil. Emits a massive Healing Nova every 10 seconds (heals 50% HP).6 CYAN Surrounding X: Singularity. Once every 30 seconds, instantly collects EVERY item/XP orb on the entire map.6 ORANGE Surrounding X: Juggernaut. The ship can no longer be stopped by enemy mass. You can push through unlimited density of enemies without slowing down.4. Developer Implementation NotesArmor Shred Math (Orange/Cyan)Orange interactions often refer to "Reducing Armor." Since enemies may not have complex stats, implement this as a Damage Multiplier Tag.JavaScript// Pseudo-code for Damage Calculation
function calculateDamage(enemy, baseDamage) {
  let multiplier = 1.0;
  if (enemy.hasEffect("CORRODED")) multiplier += 0.3; // Cyan+Orange
  if (enemy.hasEffect("ENTROPY")) multiplier += 0.5; // Orange+Cyan (Melee)
  
  return baseDamage * multiplier;
