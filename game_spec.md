Game Design Document: Hexii1. High ConceptTitle: HexiiTagline: Prove that Hexagons are the Bestagons.Genre: Geometric Horde Survival / Ship Constructor.Platform: Web (React wrapper + Phaser engine).Target Feeling: Strategic satisfaction. The joy of building a perfect machine. Controlled chaos, not frantic panic.The Core LoopSurvive: Pilot your cluster of hexagons using WASD and shoot enemies using Mouse Click/Hold.Slay: Defeat waves of geometric enemies (Triangles, Squares, Pentagons).Loot: Defeating a Boss drops a raw Hex Module.Build: The game enters "Construction Mode." The player drags the new Hex onto their ship. Adjacency matters.Win: Defeat the "Septagon" final boss.2. The Player (The Hex Cluster)The player controls a cluster of hexagons. The center is the Core.2.1 The CoreVisual: A Hexagon with a "cockpit" or "eye" in the center.Function: If the Core reaches 0 HP, Game Over.Ability: The Core always shoots (Red behavior), regardless of its color.Starting Choice: At the start of the game, the player selects the Core's color (Red, Green, Yellow, Blue). This dictates the Core's passive stats but does not remove its gun.2.2 Stats & ColorsEvery attached Hex contributes to Global Stats (additive) and Local Synergies (adjacency).ColorNameGlobal Stat (Passive)Local Behavior (Active)REDDamage+5% Global DamageWeapon: Shoots a projectile towards the mouse cursor.GREENGrowth+10 Max HPHealer: Increases HP regen. Buffs adjacent Red bullet size.YELLOWSpeed+5% Move SpeedThruster: Increases acceleration. Buffs adjacent Red fire rate.BLUEShield+10 Max ShieldBarrier: Regenerates a dedicated Shield HP bar. Buffs adjacent Red penetration.2.3 The Adjacency Logic (The "Meta")This is the heart of the game. The developer must use Axial Coordinates (not an X/Y grid) to calculate neighbors.Rule: Synergies apply to every relevant neighbor.Red + Red: If two Red hexes touch, BOTH gain +1 Projectile count.Example: A Red hex touching 3 other Red hexes will shoot 4 bullets at once.Red + Green: Red shoots massive bullets (2x damage/size).Red + Yellow: Red shoots rapid fire (0.5x cooldown).Red + Blue: Red shoots piercing bullets (pass through enemies).2.4 The "Ring of Perfection" (Ultimate)If a non-Red hex is completely surrounded by 6 hexes of the same color, it triggers an Apex Effect.6 Red surrounding X: The center hex becomes an Omni-Turret (Shoots in all 6 directions simultaneously).6 Green surrounding X: The center hex emits a Healing Nova every 5 seconds (Healing 20% HP).6 Yellow surrounding X: The center hex creates a Static Field that slows all nearby enemies.6 Blue surrounding X: The center hex grants Invulnerability for 2 seconds whenever a shield breaks.3. The EnemiesEnemies are "inferior shapes." They do not evolve; they swarm.Logic: Enemies spawn at the edge of the screen and move toward the Player Core.Color Coding: Enemies follow the player's color rules (Red enemies hurt more, Yellow move fast, Green have high HP).ShapeArchetypeMovement BehaviorCombat BehaviorTriangleSwarmerVery Fast, Low turn radius.Melee: RAM the player. Low HP.SquareTankSlow, keeps momentum.Melee: High Pushback force. High HP.PentagonArtilleryStops at range.Ranged: Shoots a single projectile at the player.SeptagonBOSSSlow, Teleports.Multi-stage boss fight. Uses bullet hell patterns.4. Controls & InputMovement: W A S D relative to screen (Up, Left, Down, Right). The ship does not rotate; it translates.Aiming: Mouse Cursor.Firing: Left Click (Hold to auto-fire recommended to reduce finger fatigue).Construction:When a new Hex is acquired, the game pauses/slows.React UI overlay appears.Player drags the new Hex from "Inventory" to a valid slot on the ship."Confirm" button resumes the game.5. Technical Architecture (React + Phaser)5.1 Tech StackReact: Handles the Game Wrapper, Main Menu, Game Over Screen, and the Construction UI.Phaser 3: Handles the Simulation, Rendering, Physics, and Input.Zustand (or Redux): State management bridge.5.2 Data Structure: The ShipThe ship should be stored as a Map or Dictionary using Axial Coordinates string keys ("q,r").JavaScript// Example Ship Data Structure
const playerShip = {
  "0,0": { type: "CORE", color: "RED", health: 100 },
  "0,-1": { type: "MODULE", color: "GREEN", health: 100 },
  "1,-1": { type: "MODULE", color: "RED", health: 100 }
}
5.3 React <-> Phaser CommunicationReact to Phaser: When the player drags a hex in the React UI, React updates the global state. Phaser subscribes to this state change and re-renders the ship sprites and recalculates physics bodies.Phaser to React: Phaser emits events (e.g., ON_HP_CHANGE, ON_BOSS_DEATH) to update the React HUD.5.4 PhysicsUse Phaser Arcade Physics for performance.Player Hitbox: The player is not one hitbox. The player is a Compound Body (if using Matter.js) or a Group of sprites.Optimization: Since we only have a general HP bar (parts don't break), the player can be approximated as a single Circle Hitbox that grows as the ship grows, OR we check collision against individual hexes but deduct from a global HP pool. Recommendation: Check collision against individual hexes for visual accuracy.6. Visuals & Audio Style (The "Feel")6.1 VisualsStyle: Minimalist Geometry. Dark background (#1a1a2e), Neon foregrounds.Feedback:On Shoot: Slight recoil on the specific Red Hex that fired.On Hit: Screen shake (small) + Red flash on the ship.On Kill: Enemies shatter into small particles.6.2 AudioMusic: Synthwave / Retrowave. Chill beats during waves, high tempo during Bosses.SFX:Red Shot: Crisp laser "Pew".Impact: Crunch/Glass breaking.Attach Hex: Heavy metallic "Clunk-Click".
